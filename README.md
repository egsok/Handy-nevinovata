> Personal fork of [cjpais/Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy) with Russian-language transcription tweaks.
> Pre-built installers (unsigned) on [Releases](https://github.com/egsok/klava-nevinovata/releases). Build from source for everything else.

This is my personal daily-driver fork of [Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy), the offline speech-to-text Tauri app. I use it for Russian transcription on Windows. The fork stays close to upstream — I cherry-pick fixes and add small features that solve concrete problems I hit. Nothing here is meant to replace upstream Handy; if you don't have the same Russian-specific pain points, just use the original.

Fork is based on upstream `main` HEAD `10a4c31` (5 docs commits past `v0.8.3`).

## What's different from upstream

- **Custom transcription prompt.** Per-language initial prompt field in Settings → Advanced for Whisper models. Useful for forcing recognition of names, jargon and stylistic preferences.
- **Multi-format clipboard preservation.** Paste-and-restore now preserves Files / Image / HTML / Text — not just the plain-text payload. Lets you keep a clipboard you copied earlier even if klava-nevinovata hijacks the buffer to inject the transcript.
- **Anti-hallucination toggle for Whisper.** Settings → Advanced switch that applies `n_max_text_ctx=128` + `entropy_thold=2.8` to `WhisperInferenceParams` (equivalent of OpenWhispr PR #552 / whisper.cpp#1507). Kills runaway loop hallucinations on long silences ("и я хочу и я хочу...").
- **Cyrillic word-boundary fixes for Breeze ASR.** Five regex passes unglue words that the Mandarin-trained Breeze model joins together (`cyr.cyr`, `lat.cyr`, `cyrCYR`, `latCYR`, single-letter variants, uppercase Latin acronyms). Gated on `selected_model == "breeze-asr"`, pure post-process in `src-tauri/src/audio_toolkit/text.rs`.
- **`/O2` compiler fix in the whisper-rs-sys fork.** cmake 4.2.3 + VS2022 silently drops `CMAKE_*_FLAGS_RELEASE` initializers, which builds whisper.cpp at `/Od` instead of `/O2`. The fork explicitly sets `/MD /O2 /Ob2 /DNDEBUG`. Empirical impact: `large-v3` RTF 0.10 → 0.06 (~1.67× faster Whisper inference on Windows).

The first four live as commits on top of upstream in this repo. The `/O2` fix lives in three sibling forks of the whisper Rust stack (`whisper-rs-sys-fork`, `whisper-rs-fork`, `transcribe-rs-fork`, all on `daily-stable` branches), wired in via `[patch.crates-io]` paths in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`. Dropping those patches removes both the `/O2` speedup AND the anti-hallucination backend.

## Download

Pre-built installers are published to [Releases](https://github.com/egsok/klava-nevinovata/releases).

- **Windows:** download `klava-nevinovata_0.8.3-N_x64-setup.exe` (NSIS) or `.msi` (N is the fork release number — 1, 2, ...). On first launch Windows SmartScreen will show "Windows protected your PC" — click **More info** → **Run anyway**. The binary is unsigned (see Build below).
- **Linux:** download `klava-nevinovata_..._amd64.deb` / `.AppImage` / `.rpm` for your distro.
- **macOS:** two builds — pick by your Mac's chip:
  - `klava-nevinovata_..._aarch64.dmg` — **Apple Silicon** Mac (M1 / M2 / M3 / M4, models from late 2020 onwards)
  - `klava-nevinovata_..._x64.dmg` — **Intel** Mac (older models, ~2006–2020)

  Not sure which? Click → **About This Mac**. If it lists a "Chip" like "Apple M1" → `aarch64`. If it lists a "Processor" like "Intel Core i7" → `x64`.

  Drag `klava-nevinovata.app` to `/Applications`. On first launch macOS will show **"klava-nevinovata is damaged and can't be opened, you should move it to the Bin"** — this is misleading; the app is not damaged, it's just unsigned and quarantined. Fix by removing the quarantine attribute in Terminal:

  ```bash
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/klava-nevinovata.app
  ```

  (If that errors with permission, try `sudo xattr -cr /Applications/klava-nevinovata.app`.) After this the app launches normally. The right-click → Open workaround that older guides mention no longer works on macOS 15+ for unsigned apps. Please report any post-launch issues in [issues](https://github.com/egsok/klava-nevinovata/issues).

## Build

If you want the bleeding edge, a platform not covered by releases, or want to audit the build yourself, build locally. (Otherwise grab a pre-built installer from [Download](#download) above.)

1. Follow upstream's [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for platform prerequisites.
2. Make sure the three sibling forks are checked out next to `klava-nevinovata/` and on the `daily-stable` branch (see `[patch.crates-io]` section of `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`).
3. On Windows, set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=d:/t/handy` (short path; whisper-rs-sys Vulkan shader paths overflow MAX_PATH otherwise) and `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2` (release profile uses `lto=true`, parallel link OOMs on 16 GB).
4. `bun install && bun run tauri build`. Ignore the final "failed to bundle project: program not found" — that's the custom-signing step, the raw `.exe` is fine.

## Upstream

This fork tracks [cjpais/Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy). For everything not listed above — installation, troubleshooting, platform-specific notes, model management, signal handling, CLI flags — see the [upstream README](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/blob/main/README.md). I don't duplicate that here so it doesn't go stale relative to upstream.

If you want the official, supported app: get it from [handy.computer](https://handy.computer) or [cjpais/Handy/releases](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/releases).

## Author

Built by [Egor Sokolov](https://egorsokolov.ru/) — 10 years in product (Sberbank, Rolf, Claustrophobia). Writing and experimenting with AI tooling — mostly Claude Code, Codex, and dev workflow tooling. I use klava-nevinovata daily for Russian voice notes; this fork is what fell out of that.

Telegram channel about AI tooling: [@neiroset_ne_vinovata](https://t.me/neiroset_ne_vinovata).

Other open-source experiments: [plan-tango](https://github.com/egsok/plan-tango) — a Claude ↔ Codex plan-review loop for Claude Code.
