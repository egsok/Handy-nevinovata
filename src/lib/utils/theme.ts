 * Handy already ships a full light palette and a full dark palette (see
 * `App.css`). This module lets the user pick which one is used instead of
 * always following the OS:
 *  - `system` removes the override so the `prefers-color-scheme` media query
 *    governs (the historical behaviour).
 *  - `light` / `dark` set `data-theme` on the document root, whose
 *    higher-specificity CSS selectors win over the media query.
 *
 * The choice is persisted in `AppSettings` (source of truth) and mirrored to
 * localStorage so it can be applied synchronously on boot, before React mounts,
 * avoiding a flash of the wrong palette.
